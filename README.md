**Our research focuses on the ecology and biogeochemistry of watersheds and aquatic ecosystems, primarily through long-term studies.** 
\
We seek to answer two overarching questions: (1) how do human interactions with land use, climate, and watershed geology transform the chemistry of inland waters; and (2) how can we evaluate and enhance watershed restoration strategies to reduce water pollution?
\
We collect, filter, preserve, and archive water samples from long-term monitoring sites. Samples are analyzed for biogenic elements such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, silicon, iron,  and manganese. Analysis of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen provide important clues regarding identification of the sources, fluxes, and transformations of chemicals in natural environments through space and time.
\
In the field, we measure in situ rates of microbial and ecosystem processes. We also analyze sensor data for complementary measurements of oxygen availability, temperature, conductivity, and other water quality parameters. 
\
In the future, we plan to build on current projects exploring the effects of the Freshwater Salinization Syndrome and human-accelerated weathering on the chemistry of inland waters; expand our studies of the interactive effects of land use, climate, and geologic change; participate in long-term research networks; and synthesize data at regional and national scales through continued service in working groups and panels.

Our work has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, Maryland Sea Grant, the Chesapeake Bay Trust, and other funding sources.
